# opensourceSW-finaltest

Hello, I'm Jong Hoon Lee, majoring in AI at Chung-Ang University. I solved the project using MLP, logic regression, random forest for open source SW final project. First of all, I took a package from sklearn and wrote it to form a model. and second bring a data from my folder like in this project brain tumor data. and continually, visualize image data to me. and since Data preprocessing has since made data more readable, data preprocessing should be possible. And I learned the model, and fit the data to the model, finally I got the accuracy. There will be a lot of improvements, but I'd appreciate it if you look at it carefully because it's a model that I made so hard.
