# opensourceSW-finaltest

Hello, I'm Jong Hoon Lee, majoring in AI at Chung-Ang University. I solved the project using MLP, logic regression, random forest for open source SW final project. First of all, I took a package from sklearn and wrote it to form a model. Data preprocessing has since made data more readable. And I learned the model, and I got the accuracy. There will be a lot of improvements, but I'd appreciate it if you look at it carefully because it's a model that 
I made so hard.
