# opensourceSW-finaltest

 Hello, I'm Jong Hoon Lee, majoring in AI at Chung-Ang University. For the open-source SW final project, we used a soft majority classification model using Randomforest classifier and KNN. This model is used when all classifiers used in an ensemble can predict the probability of a class. We use a weighted voting method that averages the predictions for the brain tumour of the classifier and KNN, respectively, to predict them to the most likely model. The randomforestclassifier used parameter n_estimators=100 to specify the number of decision trees and random_state=32 to determine the random state. In addition, the KNeighbors Classifier use parameter to set the number of adjacent samples to be considered for classification to n_n neighbors=5, and use weights='distance' which gives different weights depending on the distance of adjacent samples when classifying and that parameter give  big weights when close. And I learned the model, and fit the data to the model, finally I got the accuracy. There will be a lot of improvements, but I'd appreciate it if you look at it carefully because it's a model that I made so hard.
